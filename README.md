# Spotter
## About this app
This App was Sarah Keashly and I's final project for LHL. 
We created a modern, reactive, and response social media app designed to share and play music with your friends.

## Dev Notes
I'm still working on an updated version of Spotter, I plan to release and publish this and am working as hard as I can to get this made.
Some features i'd love to add are:
- Find mutual followers off Spotify -> reccommend them for a logged in spotter user
- visually show a different user page, as well as a button to add them to our followers
- impliment other features such as youtube music, soundcloud, and uploading raw audio files
and much more...
